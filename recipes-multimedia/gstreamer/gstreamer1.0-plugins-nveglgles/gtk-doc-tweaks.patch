Subject: [PATCH] gstreamer: disable gtk-doc builds

The gtk-doc patch from OE-Core is for the makefiles that
come with much more recent versions of the gstreamer plugin
build system than the version on which the NVIDIA plugin is
based, and it would be difficult to retrofit, so for now
just disable gtk-doc builds.
